# Twin Networks and Causal Models
A model for creating and handling Structural Causal models. Additional benefits:

- Easy creation and handling of twin networks.
- Run approximate interventional/counterfactual inference on SCMs with [Pyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro).
- Run exact inference in SCMs with [pgmpy](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy).

See `demo.ipynb` for examples of usage.

This is still very much research code. It's expected to be buggy, but the basics work.
It's useful for playing around with SCMs in a native Python class, and especially for
approximate inference.

## Directory structure

```
- scm.py                  |  contains the CausalModel class, which handles and generates independent noise SCMs (binary or continuous).
- exact.py                |  contains the ExactCounterfactual class for performing and timing exact counterfactual inference with pgmpy.
- approximate.py          |  contains the ApproximateCounterfactual class for performing approximate counterfactual inference with Pyro.
- CustomVariableElimination.py |  slightly modifies the pgmpy ExactInference file to time elimination-based inference.
- experiments.py          |  contains the Experiment class which generates experiments: an SCM, node of interest, evidence, and intervention.
- demo.ipynb              |  a Jupyter notebook giving examples of basic functionality.
